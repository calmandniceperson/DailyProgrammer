# 321 Talking Clock (Easy)

This is an implementation of [DailyProgrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) challenge [321 - Talking Clock (Easy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6jr76h/20170627_challenge_321_easy_talking_clock/).

Not the most elegant solution, but well, it's what I came up with during a Meetup. (edit: and at least it's using *snprintf* instead of *strcat* [now](https://github.com/calmandniceperson/DailyProgrammer/commit/8b967a9551430b45547cb34abbf72ad037eaafc1)).
